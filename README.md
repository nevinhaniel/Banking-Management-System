# Banking-management-system
This is a Banking Management System built using the concepts of Object Oriented Programming In C++. 


# Introduction

The “Bank Account Management System” project is a model Internet Banking Site. This site enables the customers to perform the basic banking transactions by sitting at their office or at homes through PC or laptop. The system provides the access to the customer to create an account, deposit/withdraw the cash from his account, also to view reports of all accounts present. The customers can access the banks website for viewing their Account details and perform the transactions on account as per their requirements. With Internet Banking, the brick and mortar structure of the traditional banking gets converted into a click and portal model, thereby giving a concept of virtual banking a real shape. Thus, today's banking is no longer confined to branches. E-banking facilitates banking transactions by customers round the clock globally. 

The primary aim of this “Bank Account Management System” is to provide an improved design methodology, which envisages the future expansion, and modification, which is necessary for a core sector like banking. This necessitates the design to be expandable and modifiable and so a modular approach is used in developing the application software. 

Anybody who is an Account holder in this bank can become a member of Bank Account 
Management System. He has to fill a form with his personal details and Account Number. 
Bank is the place where customers feel the sense of safety for their property. In the bank, customers deposit and withdraw their money. Transaction of money also is a part where customer takes shelter of the bank. Now to keep the belief and trust of customers, there is the positive need for management of the bank, which can handle all this with comfort and ease. 
Smooth and efficient management affects the satisfaction of the customers and staff members, indirectly. And of course, it encourages management committee in taking some needed decision for future enhancement of the bank. 

Now a day’s, managing a bank is tedious job up to certain limit. So software that reduces the work is essential. Also, today’s world is a genuine computer world and is getting faster and faster day-by-day. Thus, considering above necessities, the software for bank management has become necessary which would be useful in managing the bank more efficiently. 
All transactions are carried out online by transferring from accounts in the same Bank or international bank. The software is meant to overcome the drawbacks of the manual system. 


# Abstract

The Bank Account Management System is an application for maintaining a person's account in a bank. In this project I tried to show the working of a banking account system and cover the basic functionality of a Bank Account Management System. To develop a project for solving financial applications of a customer in banking environment in order to nurture the needs of an end banking user by providing various ways to perform banking tasks. Also, to enable the user’s work space to have additional functionalities which are not provided under a conventional banking project. 

The Bank Account Management System undertaken as a project is based on relevant technologies. The main aim of this project is to develop software for Bank Account Management System. This project has been developed to carry out the processes easily and quickly, which is not possible with the manuals systems, which are overcome by this software. This project is developed using C++  language. Creating and managing requirements is a challenge of IT, systems and product development projects or indeed for any activity where you have to manage a contractual relationship. Organization need to effectively define and manage requirements to ensure they are meeting needs of the customer, while proving compliance and staying on the schedule and within budget. 

The impact of a poorly expressed requirement can bring a business out of compliance or even cause injury or death. Requirements definition and management is an activity that can deliver a high, fast return on investment. The project analyzes the system requirements and then comes up with the requirements specifications. It studies other related systems and then come up with system specifications. The system is then designed in accordance with specifications to satisfy the requirements. The system design is then implemented with C++ using OPP concepts. The system is designed as an interactive and content management system. The content management system deals with data entry, validation confirm and updating whiles the interactive system deals with system interaction with the administration and users. Thus, above features of this project will save transaction time and therefore increase the efficiency of the system



# AIM of this project

The main aim of designing and developing this Internet banking System C++ primarily based 
Engineering project is to provide secure and efficient net banking facilities to the banking customers over the internet. Apart for new features Apache Server Pages, MYSQL database used to develop this bank application where all banking customers can login through the secured web page by their account login id and password. Users will have all options and features in that application like get money from western union, money transfer to others, and send cash or money to inter banking as well as other banking customers by simply adding them as payees.


# Main Purpose
The Traditional way of maintaining details of a user in a bank was to enter the details and record them. Every time the user needs to perform some transactions he has to go to bank and perform the necessary actions, which may not be so feasible all the time.

## Benefits of online banking

Many of us lead busy lives. Some of us are up before the crack of dawn, getting ourselves prepared so we can in turn get our families ready for the day. We rush to work, rush to get the kids to school, and at the end of the day we rush home only to brace ourselves for the next day. After a hectic day, the last thing you want to do is spend time waiting in line at the bank, or even the post office. That's where Online Banking comes in. Many of the benefits of doing our banking online are obvious: 
 
1- You don't have to wait in line. 
2- You don't have to plan your day around the bank's hours. 
3- You can look at your balance whenever you want, not just when you get a statement. 

There are some hidden benefits too. As a young bank customer, you're just learning how to manage your money and observe your spending patterns. 
Online banking allows you to watch your money on a daily basis if you want to. By keeping close tabs on your funds, you'll always be aware of what's happening in your bank account. 
For those experienced spenders, this option is far more appealing than the sudden discovery that you're broke! 

It's also helpful to watch how much interest you're gathering on investments and savings or what service charges you have incurred. 

# Most available benefits 

1. Online banking with key bank is fast, secure, convenient and free. 
2. Quick, simple, authenticated access to accounts via the web application. 
3. Simply scalable to grow with changing system requirement. 
4. Global enterprise wide access to information. 
5. Improved data security, restricting unauthorized access. 
6. Minimize Storage Space. 


# Future Look

The “Banking Online System is a big and ambitious project. I am thankful for being provided this great opportunity to work on it. As already mentioned, this project has gone through extensive research work. On the basis of the research work, we have successfully designed and implemented banking online System. To know what the future of online banking looks like, it’s probably worth looking at the present – online banking isn’t new. When you think of online banking, you probably think about a computer (either a desktop or laptop), a three or four step security process and then an interface that lets you view the balance of your various bank accounts and credit cards, whilst permitting you to transfer money and pay bills. And you’re not wrong either. The most valuable future looks are following below: 
 
1- More branches of the bank, maybe it will be international, that means more ATM machines outside. 
2- Customer issues development based on their needs, so the help desk will be aware of their needs and easy to use. 
3- Developing a mobile App for banking system that help users to do the obtained his operations without go to the bank only he needs to sign in using his A/C NO. And password and then use your own PIN. Finally the system will update automatically.
